# Phase 2: Enhanced Automation

## 1. Auto-Sync Vault
Automatically pull new uploads from Instagram, ArtStation, or Behance directly into the Overlord Vault, running AI tagging in the background so the artist never has to manually organize files.

## 2. AI Negotiation Assistant
Based on the "Client Match Score," suggest the best psychological approach for the pitch (e.g., "This client values speed over detail, highlight your 24-hour turnaround assets").

## 3. Smart Contracts Integration
Generate a contract that matches the specific assets selected in the Dynamic Portfolio, ensuring licensing terms are automatically aligned with the work shown.
